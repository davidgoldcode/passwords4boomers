					<h2> What is this? </h2>
					<p>Over time, I've noticed that my parents passwords are simple, predictable and guessable. In turn, this makes them <b>hackable</b>. <br><br>I created this presentation to introduce them to my favorite <a href="https://1password.com/landing/password-manager/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=10693428634&utm_content=485019800872&utm_term=onepassword&gclid=CjwKCAiA57D_BRAZEiwAZcfCxR2Em6nED1UJoWVD59bZ7W7ev7M-vrUxSqnqnGn3RcE4BAn2Gm8M-BoC0hYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">password manager</a>.</p>

				<!-- The Old Way -->

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The old way</h2>
						<p>I can recall some of the methods of creating passwords:</p>
						<small>
							<ul>
								<li>The street you grew up on</li>
								<li>Your favorite color</li>
								<li>A pet's name</li>
							</ul>
						</small>
						<br><br>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<h1>ðŸ‘‡</h1>
						</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The New Way</h2>
						<p>The new prevailing philosophy on password security is to use something called a password manager where you don't know <strong><u>any</u></strong> of your passwords</p>
						<p>More on this later</p>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<h1>ðŸ‘‡</h1>
						</a>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But first...</h2>
						<p>Why do we care?</p>

				<!-- What is Hacking? -->

						<h2>Hacking</h2>
						<p>By using weak passwords, we open ourselves up to hacking</p>
						<p class="fragment">...but what is <span class="fragment highlight-red">hacking</span>?</p>

						<h2 class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="2">Is it this?</h2>

					<section>
						<h2>What is it really?</h2>
						<p>The majority of hacking to folks like you and me comes from something called</p>
						<div class="r-hstack justify-center">
						<div ><span class="fragment highlight-red " data-id="box1">password reuse</span></div>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Simply put, password reuse is reusing the same password across different services</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in" >You know... passwords like "password" or the name of your first dog</p>
					</section>

						<p>Bad actors will get access to a list of login credentials and try those combinations across banks, instagram, etc</p>

						<p class="fragment fade-in " data-fragment-index="2"> No, not THAT type of bad actor</p>

						<h4>An example</h4>

						<p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">In 2014, Yahoo was reportedly hacked to the tune of almost nearly 500 million users</p>

				<!-- Final remarks -->

				<section>
					<section>
						<h6>I hope you appreciated this presentation, Boomer</h6>
						<h6>Before I leave you, I want to give you some final tips</h6>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Tip #1: Use a password manager</h3>
						<p>We get hacked because we're human. Let technology handle secure information for you. They're better at it</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h3>Tip #2: Be cautious over email</h3>
						<p>Bad actors can spoof their emails to make it look like it's coming from a legitimate source. Right click on senders contact names to verify that it's coming from a proper source. </p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img height='400' src='./assets/fake_netflix.png'>
						<p>As I was making this, my sister sent me a text asking if this email was legitimately from Netflix </p>
						<p class='fragment highlight-red'>It wasn't.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h6>Presumably, the "reset password" link takes you to some random website in hopes of stealing your password</h6>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Tip #3: Stay real on social media</h4>
						<br>
						<p>Websites like Facebook and LinkedIn will prevent people who you aren't connected with from seeing your entire profile</p>
						<p>Hackers might create fake profiles and try to add you in attempt to gain access to more information</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Exercise caution before connecting with somebody.</h4> 
						<h4> If you have reason to believe it might be a fake account, call or email that friend to verify it is in fact them.</h4>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Tip #4: Be careful before downloading anything from the web</h4>
						<br>
						<p>If sites have pop ups asking you to download anything, don't do it</p>
						<p>Many nefarious sites have fake pop ups in hopes of downloading malware (bad!) onto your computer. You can learn more about <a href="https://tweaklibrary.com/spot-fake-virus-malware-warnings/">how to spot those here</a></p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Tip #5: Turn on automatic security updates</h4>
						<br>
						<p>Updates can happen for many reasons, and it's not always security related. But it's best to get updates as often and early as they're available</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Tip #6: Be skeptical on the phone</h4>
						<br>
						<p>It's unwise to give personal information out over the phone. Generally speaking, I'd suggest against it. </p>
						<br>
						<p>I never answer any unknown numbers. If it's important they'll leave a message. If I suspect it might require secure information, I can atleast vet their callback number.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Tip #7: Use 2-factor authentication</h4>
						<br>
						<p> I could make another whole presentation on 2-factor authentication (2FA), but I won't. <a href="https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/">Click here</a> to learn more about what it is </p>
